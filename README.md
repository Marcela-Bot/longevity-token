# Longevity-token
Description
LongevityToken is a blockchain-based platform using an ERC-721 NFT token to provide access to advanced medical treatments, supplements, and other services focused on longevity and health advancement. Through this token, users can access gene therapies, participate in voting on new treatments, and earn rewards for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Token Characteristics
1. Token Type
An ERC-721 NFT will be used, ensuring that each token is unique and non-fungible. Tokens will be related to the user’s identity and health, granting access to longevity-related benefits.

2. Token Utility
Tokens can be used for the following services:

Advanced medical treatments such as gene therapies.

Discounts and supplements related to health.

Participation in voting on new therapies or supplements to be added to the platform.

3. Token Quantity
The total number of tokens will be fixed, established at the start of the project to avoid inflation or devaluation of the token. Tokens will be distributed based on platform participation (e.g., completing verified health studies or healthy lifestyle activities).

4. Token Distribution
Tokens will be distributed as follows:

Through verified healthy habits: Users will receive tokens for completing actions such as improving sleep habits, maintaining a healthy diet, and completing verified medical studies.

Token purchase: Users will also be able to purchase tokens directly to access additional treatments or services.

5. Unlock Period
Tokens will be immediately available for essential treatments such as gene therapies, with no waiting period. However, a gradual unlock period will be implemented for other benefits (e.g., supplements and non-urgent therapies), conditioned on verified healthy habits. This will help ensure tokens are not “wasted” quickly and will encourage users to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

6. Token - User Interaction
Tokens will allow users to:

Pay for advanced medical treatments (such as gene therapies).

Vote on new therapies or treatments to be added to the platform.

Earn rewards for staking and holding their tokens.

7. Token Value
The token value will be fixed, adjusted based on available services on the platform. A fixed value will allow stability for users and ensure that token usage is not affected by market fluctuations.

8. Health Decision Voting
Token holders will be able to vote on:

New treatments or therapies to be added to the platform.

Supplements related to longevity and health advancement.

Users who wish to propose new treatments must present evidence-based arguments (e.g., scientific articles, clinical studies, etc.).

9. Staking Rewards
Users will be able to stake their tokens and receive additional rewards (extra tokens) as an incentive to not sell their tokens immediately. This mechanism will help promote token retention and long-term investment.

10. Burning Tokens
A portion of the tokens used on the platform will be burned (removed from circulation) to reduce the total supply, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. This will be done in moderation to ensure that it does not negatively affect the user experience.

LongevityToken Strategy Summary
1. Total Initial Supply:
100 million tokens: This will ensure there are enough tokens for the first few years while the platform grows and expands globally.

2. Token Distribution:
60-70% for active users: This percentage will be distributed to those participating in verifiable healthy habits, such as improving sleep, maintaining a balanced diet, and attending verified health events. Tokens will also be awarded for completing health activities certified by doctors or wellness experts.

20-30% for incentives and staking: This percentage will be allocated to reward users who stake their tokens, promoting token retention in the long term.

5-10% for platform and development: This portion will be used for platform development, partnerships with clinics, health events, and other operational costs. It will also be reserved for future expansions.

3. Token Acquisition through Verified Healthy Events:
Tickets for certified healthy events: Users will be able to purchase tickets for verified healthy events that meet specific conditions, such as good air quality and controlled noise levels.

Event Certification: Event organizers must meet certain standards, such as measuring air quality and noise levels, for the event to be considered "healthy." Users will receive tokens for attending these events and fulfilling wellness expectations.

Event Rating Platform: Users will be able to rate events on the platform. If someone experiences health issues due to the event (e.g., poor air quality or excessive noise), they can report it on the platform, and the community can vote to determine whether the event was healthy or not.

Event Reputation: Events with better reputations (higher community ratings) could receive more tokens or incentives. This creates a positive feedback system where healthy events are rewarded and those that don’t meet standards are penalized.

4. Global Accessibility and Token Purchase with Fiat Currency:
Token purchase: Users will be able to purchase tokens not only with cryptocurrencies but also with fiat currency, using traditional payment gateways. This opens up the platform to a broader audience, including those without prior cryptocurrency experience.

This will also allow users to purchase tokens for additional services, such as advanced treatments or longevity-related supplements.

5. Fixed Token Value and Token Stability:
Fixed Token Value: The value of the token will be fixed, which will guarantee stability and allow users to know how many tokens they need for services. This strategy helps avoid price volatility and builds trust in the platform.

Stability Mechanisms: We will maintain a controlled token supply and use mechanisms such as staking and token burning to manage inflation and ensure the token’s value remains stable.
